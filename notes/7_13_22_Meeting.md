# Housekeeping
- Hardware Check-in
- Presentations
  - 30 minute, presented as a team followed by 10-15 minutes QA, 8/4 9:30 am Data Processing Tag Up

# Raw QA plots/statistics
- Review QA for each  platform implemented

# Normalization Goals/Overview
- Normalizing to control technical variation
- Feature Set level Normalized Expression Table
	- Goals: 
  	- one row per unique gene
    - Saving that to file
    -      , Sample_1, Sample_2
    - gene1, 10.8    , 12.8
    - gene2, 4       , 39.8  
- Probe level Unnormalized Expression Tables (likely doable)
- Feature Set level Unnormalized Expression Tables (maybe doable)

## TODO: Add sample legend
